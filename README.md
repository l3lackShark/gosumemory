Yet another memory reader for osu! Supports both Linux and Windows. (**requires sudo on Linux** though since only root can read /proc)

# Usage
     
1. [Download the latest Release](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/releases/latest)
    * Unzip files anywhere
    > In the root folder of the program, you can find the **static** directory. It contains all of the available counters. Those are getting streamed via HTTP-File server

2. Run gosumemory & osu!
    * Visit this link in your browser: http://localhost:24050 and choose the counter that you like.
    * Add a browser source in OBS (Width and Height could be found in the **Included counters** spoiler)
4. If using built-in counters covers all of your needs, then you are done here.
> **Please note that auto-updates only cover the executable itself, however, if a new counter gets released, we will mention it in the Release Notes.**\
> If you want to make your own, just create a new directory in the *static* folder.  

# Does this work in-game?

Yes! see [this](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/wiki/GameOverlay)

# How does it work?

gosumemory streams WebSocket data to **ws://localhost:24050/ws** that you can use in any programming language to develop a frontend. We recommend JavaScript though, as it's much easier to make something pretty with the Web framework. All of the included counters are good starting points. There is also http://localhost:24050/json that you can open in a web browser to see the available data. We strongly recommend against sending GET requests to that address in production, please **use WebSocket instead**.

**[Example JSON and a little wiki of it's values](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/wiki/JSON-values)**

# What if I don't know any programming languages but still want to output data to OBS?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ApXBEO5bes 

# How do I submit a pp counter?

Head over to [static](https://github.com/l3lackShark/static) and create a pull request there. If it's good quality, then it will get approved and included in the next release.

# Tournament Client

When operating in tourney mode, real-time pp counters for each client, leaderboard and grades don't work. Each gameplay object is sorted by tournament client "id", "menu" object is a tournament manager (state 22). 
**Tournament mode works only with Cutting Edge tourney client and is not supported on Linux.**

# Linux

You have two options. Either run native, but with sudo privileges, or through WINE. Make sure to have dotnet45 installed, otherwise gosumemory won't be able to find the correct memory addresses.
Please note that Linux builds are not well tested and could contain crashes. Report them if you encounter any.
